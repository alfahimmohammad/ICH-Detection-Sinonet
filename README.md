# ICH-detection-Sinonet
 
This repository contains the code of my bachelor's thesis: "Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhages in CT Sinograms using CNN-RNN Architectures." The dataset was generated from the publicly available ICH RSNA dataset in Kaggle using Scikit's radon transform. The models were developed and trained in Keras and Tensorflow.
